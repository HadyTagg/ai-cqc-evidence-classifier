  title: Learning culture
  we_statement: |-
    We expect providers, commissioners and system leaders live up to this statement: We have a proactive and positive culture of safety based on openness and honesty, in which concerns about safety are listened to, safety events are investigated and reported thoroughly, and lessons are learned to continually identify and embed good practices.
  we_explanation: ''

    including staff as well as people using the service. There is a culture of safety
        and learning. This is based on openness, transparency and learning from events
        that have either put people and staff at risk of harm, or that have caused them
        harm.

        - Risks are not overlooked or ignored. They are dealt with willingly as an opportunity
        to put things right, learn and improve.

        - People and staff are encouraged and supported to raise concerns, they feel confident
        that they will be treated with compassion and understanding, and won’t be blamed,
        or treated negatively if they do so.

        - Raising concerns helps to proactively identify and manage risks before safety
        events happen.

        - Incidents and complaints are appropriately investigated and reported.

        - Lessons are learned from safety incidents or complaints, resulting in changes
        that improve care for others.

    throughout people’s care journey. This happens through a collaborative, joined-up
        approach to safety that involves them along with staff and other partners in their
        care. This includes referrals, admissions and discharge, and where people are
        moving between services.

        - There is a strong awareness of the risks to people across their care journeys.

        and communities in ways that ensure continuity.

  title: Safeguarding
  we_statement: |-
    We expect providers, commissioners and system leaders live up to this statement: We work with people to understand what being safe means to them as well as with our partners on the best way to achieve this.

        - There are effective systems, processes and practices to make sure people are
        protected from abuse and neglect.

        and neglect. This includes working with partners in a collaborative way.

        or neglect.

        - Where applicable, there is a clear understanding of the Deprivation of Liberty
        Safeguards (DoLS) and this is only used when it is in the best interest of the
        person.

        - Safeguarding systems, processes and practices mean that people’s human rights
        are upheld and they are protected from discrimination.

        - People are supported to understand their rights, including their human rights,
        rights under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and their rights under the Equality
        Act 2010.

    to keep themselves safe.

        - Risks are assessed, and people and staff understand them.

        this in a positive way that protects their rights and dignity and maximises learning
        for the future about the causes of their distress.

        - Restraint is only ever used as a last resort. If staff use restraint, it is
        lawful, for a legitimate purpose, safe and necessary, and staff always follow
        best practice. Where relevant, equality and human rights legislation is considered.
        The service always takes a proportionate approach to imposing restrictions on
        people. People’s care plans reflect any foreseeable risks that may need restrictions.
